## About the Cryptocurrency
A cryptocurrency is a form of digital asset based on a network that is distributed across a large number of computers. This decentralized structure allows them to exist outside the control of governments and central authorities. Some experts believe that blockchain and related technology will disrupt many industries, including finance and law. The advantages of cryptocurrencies include cheaper and faster money transfers and decentralized systems that do not collapse at a single point of failure. The disadvantages of cryptocurrencies include their price volatility, high energy consumption for mining activities, and use in criminal activities.

## Where to access the project?
This project is fully functional and ready to run on local system. Previous version of project went offline due to dependecy issues. The more advanced version of this project will be live soon. You can visit [Click Here:- Live Crypto price prediction.]()

##  Basic Architecture:
This is a very basic overview of an entire architecture of this project shown in below image.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems. This is a behavior required in complex problem domains like machine translation, speech recognition, and more. LSTMs are a complex area of deep learning. It can be hard to get your hands around what LSTMs are, and how terms like bidirectional and sequence-to-sequence relate to the field. Above diagram shows the simple structure of LSTM archtecture consist of one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer. For more detailed overview, you can refer [LSTM](https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article-abstract/9/8/1735/6109/Long-Short-Term-Memory?redirectedFrom=fulltext).
